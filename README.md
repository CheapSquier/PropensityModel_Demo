A demo propensity model implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, based on a bank marketing dataset available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing. Besides the usual python data libraries, also makes use of https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/over_sampling.html to allow more control over the balance of categories in the train and test partitions used not just for model training, but also for model evaluation. It also lets us have a consistent train/test dataset regardless of the model or evaluation type and we don't have to depend on the model having a "balance" option. Also uses the Predictive Power Score library (read about it here: https://towardsdatascience.com/rip-correlation-introducing-the-predictive-power-score-3d90808b9598) for feature selection.
